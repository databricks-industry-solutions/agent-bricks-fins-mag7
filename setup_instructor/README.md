# Instructor Setup

Set up the full financial analysis multi-agent system on Databricks. You can run everything at once or set up each brick individually.

## Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with serverless compute enabled
- Unity Catalog access with permissions to create schemas, volumes, tables, and functions
- Python environment with `databricks-sdk` installed (for local execution)
- **(Optional)** You.com web search — via UC functions using the free tier (Step 4b, recommended, no API key needed) or MCP server (Step 7, requires API key)

## Step 0: Configure Your Environment

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Start here!**

Before running any setup, update `../config.py` with your workspace settings:

```python
catalog = "your_catalog_name"
schema = "your_schema_name" 
volume_name = "raw_documents"
sa_name = "Supervisor_Agent_Mag7"
```

This configuration determines where:
- Financial data tables will be created
- Documents will be uploaded (UC Volume)
- Genie Spaces will be registered
- Agents and UC Functions will be stored

## Quick Start — Run All

Open `run_all.ipynb` and run each cell in order. This will:

0. Load your configuration from `config.py`
1. Set up data tables (ticker data ingestion)
2. Create the Knowledge Assistant with financial documents
3. Create the Genie Space for SQL queries
4. Register the Vega-Lite UC Function for visualizations
5. Create the Supervisor Agent (discovers the above artifacts automatically)
6. Deploy the Chatbot App with Lakebase database and all required permissions
7. **(Optional)** Add the You.com MCP server for web search capabilities

> Note: Steps 2-4 may take several minutes to provision. The Supervisor (step 5) requires the KA to be ONLINE before it can be created. Step 6 deploys a full-stack chatbot app (React + Express) connected to the Supervisor Agent. Step 7 requires the Supervisor to exist and a `you-mcp` Unity Catalog connection configured with your You.com API key.

## Individual Setup

Run each notebook in order. Steps 1-4 can be executed independently, but step 5 depends on artifacts from steps 2-4.

| # | File | What it creates |
|---|------|----------------|
| 0 | `../config.py` | **[EDIT FIRST]** Configure catalog, schema, volume names, and supervisor agent name |
| 1 | Data setup notebook | Ticker data tables in your UC catalog/schema |
| 2 | `01_instructor_setup_ka.ipynb` | Knowledge Assistant with financial document sources (10-K, 10-Q, earnings) |
| 3 | `02_instructor_setup_genie.ipynb` | Genie Space for natural language SQL queries against ticker data |
| 4 | `03_create_vegalite_uc_function_simple.ipynb` | UC Function for generating Vega-Lite chart specs |
| 4b | `03b_create_youdotcom_uc_functions.ipynb` | **(Optional)** You.com web search, content extraction, and research UC functions |
| 5 | `04_instructor_setup_sa.ipynb` | Supervisor Agent that orchestrates all three bricks above |
| 6 | `06_deploy_chatbot_app.ipynb` | Chatbot App with Lakebase DB, connected to the Supervisor Agent |
| 7 | `05_create_mcp_server_OPTIONAL.ipynb` | **(Optional)** Adds You.com web search MCP server to the Supervisor |

Steps 2-4 are independent and can be run in any order. Step 4b is optional and adds web search capabilities via You.com UC functions (requires a free API key — see below). Step 5 discovers the artifacts from steps 2-4 automatically by name. Step 6 deploys the chatbot app and requires the Supervisor from step 5. Step 7 is optional and requires the Supervisor from step 5 to already exist.

### Step 4b: You.com Web Search UC Functions (Optional)

Adds three UC functions that call the [You.com MCP server](https://docs.you.com/build-with-agents/mcp-server) free tier, giving your Supervisor Agent real-time web search, content extraction, and research capabilities — **no API key, no signup, no billing required**.

**Why UC functions instead of the MCP approach (Step 7)?**
- **Free tier** — no API key, no signup, no billing needed
- No need to configure a Unity Catalog connection with bearer token authentication
- No Databricks secret scopes to manage
- Native UC function integration with the Supervisor Agent

**Prerequisites:**
1. USAGE + CREATE permissions on your catalog.schema
2. That's it! No API key needed.
3. **Run `03b_create_youdotcom_uc_functions.ipynb`** — creates the UC functions and adds them to the Supervisor

**Functions created:**
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `you_web_search` | Web and news search with filtering by recency, country |
| `you_content_extract` | Full page content extraction from URLs (markdown/HTML) |
| `you_research` | Deep web research with content from multiple sources |

> **Note:** Step 4b must be run **after** step 5 (Supervisor creation) since it adds the functions to the existing Supervisor. If running for the first time, run steps 1-5 first, then come back to 4b.

### Step 6: Chatbot App Deployment

The chatbot app (`06_deploy_chatbot_app.ipynb`) deploys a full-stack web application that provides a chat UI for your Supervisor Agent:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite with streaming responses, Vega-Lite chart rendering, and chat history
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Vercel AI SDK for Databricks agent integration
- **Database**: Lakebase (managed PostgreSQL) for persistent chat history
- **Permissions**: Automatically grants `CAN_QUERY` on the MAS endpoint and all sub-agent endpoints

**What the notebook does:**
1. Discovers the MAS serving endpoint name automatically
2. Identifies all sub-agent endpoints for permission grants
3. Creates a Lakebase database instance for chat history
4. Creates the Databricks App with all resource bindings
5. Deploys source code from the workspace

**Configuration** (set in `config.py`):
```python
app_name = "agent-bricks-chatbot"           # App name prefix
lakebase_instance_name = "agent-bricks-lakebase"  # Lakebase instance name prefix
app_resource_suffix = "workshop"            # Suffix for all resource names
```

The app will be available at `https://{app_name}-{suffix}-{workspace_id}.{region}.databricksapps.com` once deployed.

### Step 7 Prerequisites (Optional MCP Server)

To add web search capabilities via the You.com MCP server:

1. **Get a You.com API key**: Sign up and obtain your key at [documentation.you.com/quickstart](https://documentation.you.com/quickstart#get-your-api-key)
2. **Create a Unity Catalog connection** named `you-mcp`:
   - Type: HTTP
   - URL: `https://api.you.com:443/mcp`
   - Authentication: Bearer token using your You.com API key
3. **Run `05_create_mcp_server_OPTIONAL.ipynb`** to attach the MCP server to your Supervisor Agent

## Configuration

All notebooks read from `../config.py` for catalog, schema, volume, and supervisor agent name settings. Make sure to update this file with your workspace-specific values before running any setup.

## Troubleshooting

- **Config not found**: Make sure `../config.py` exists and contains `catalog`, `schema`, `volume_name`, and `sa_name` variables.
- **Permission errors**: Verify you have CREATE permissions on your catalog/schema for tables, volumes, and functions.
- **Timeout errors**: Brick creation API calls can take minutes. A timeout usually means the request was submitted successfully — check the Databricks workspace UI for status.
- **KA endpoint not found**: The Knowledge Assistant needs to finish provisioning (status: ONLINE) before the Supervisor can reference it. Wait 5-15 minutes for document indexing, then re-run step 5.
- **MCP server not found**: Ensure the `you-mcp` Unity Catalog connection exists and is configured with a valid You.com API key. See [Step 6 Prerequisites](#step-6-prerequisites-optional-mcp-server) above.
- **Serverless compute issues**: If using `%run` commands on serverless, use `dbutils.notebook.run()` instead for cross-notebook execution.
